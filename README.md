# ruby-booker 0.0.19

This gem provides a simple ruby layer for integrating with the [Booker
API](http://apidoc.booker.com/Content/index.html)

It's currently a work in progress as I am building a project for work that uses
this API.

I've tried to make it fairly easy to add missing API calls so please submit PRs
if it's missing some that you want.
