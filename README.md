# ruby-booker 0.0.1

This gem provides a simple ruby layer for integrating with the [Booker
API](http://apidoc.booker.com/Content/index.html)

It's currently a work in progress as I am building a project for work that uses
the api. It's likely going to have the API calls that I will need for this
project until I have time to add the rest. But, Feel free to submit PRs if you
want to some of themissing api functions.
